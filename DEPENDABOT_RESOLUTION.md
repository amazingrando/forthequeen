- No outstanding security vulnerabilities remain from the 2022-2023 dependabot alerts
- Current dependency versions supersede all proposed dependabot fixes

## Actions Taken

1. **Dependency Analysis**: Reviewed all 8 dependabot branches and their proposed security fixes
2. **Version Verification**: Confirmed current package.json versions are newer than dependabot proposals
3. **Security Resolution**: Verified that current dependency configuration addresses all identified vulnerabilities
4. **Documentation**: Created this comprehensive resolution documentation

## Recommendations

1. **Close Dependabot PRs**: All 8 dependabot branches can be safely closed as their fixes are already implemented
2. **Regular Updates**: Continue to monitor and update dependencies regularly
3. **Security Scanning**: Run periodic security audits to catch new vulnerabilities early
4. **Automated Updates**: Consider enabling automated security updates for future vulnerability management

## Dependencies Already at Secure Versions

### Direct Dependencies (package.json)
- `gatsby-transformer-remark`: `^6.14.0` (much newer than dependabot's 5.25.1)
- All other direct dependencies are at current, secure versions

### Indirect Dependencies (package-lock.json)
- All packages flagged by dependabot are now at secure versions through the lock file
- Package resolution has addressed all security vulnerabilities identified in 2022-2023

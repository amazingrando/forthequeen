Licencing of _For the Queen_ is now possible with the April 2019 release of our system reference document (SRD) using the moniker "_Descended From the Queen_". The contents of the SRD are available for use under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license.

Use of this license will simply require that you make a clear statement (we’ll give you the text) that your game is based on our material. Unlike some other Creative Commons options, this is not “viral”—you don’t have to make your derived content open at all. We think it’s awesome if you do, though, because it means you’re contributing something back to the community.

## _Descended From the Queen_

To make legal use of the _Descended From the Queen_ logo, you must include the following text:

<div class="well">
<em>For the Queen</em>™ is a trademark of Alex Roberts. The _Descended From the Queen_ Logo is © Alex Roberts, and is used with permission.
</div>

**TODO: _Descended From the Queen_ Logos**

### A Guide To Using the _For the Queen_ SRD with Creative Commons

This is aimed at designers, writers, and publishers who’d like to build on the Creative Commons release of the _For the Queen_ System Reference Document. From here on in, we’ll just call it “the SRD”.

The most important thing to understand if you’re new to Creative Commons licenses is that we’ve chosen the most liberal one possible. In particular, the license we chose isn’t viral, which means you don’t have to license those works under a Creative Commons license if you don’t want to!

## Copying

The first right you have under the Creative Commons Attribution license is a straight-up copy of the SRD. If you do this, just remember to include the original copyright notice found in those documents, and don’t add any kind of copy protection.

## Non-US Works

It might be useful for you to know that the Creative Commons Attribution Unported license was written using the terminology of the Berne Convention and various WIPO Copyright treaties, so you shouldn’t run into any problems if you’re publishing in a jurisdiction other than the United States.

(If you are interested in translating the _For the Queen_ for publication, that's a different matter. Contact Alex Roberts to work out the details and licensing contract in that case. The SRD material does not cover translations of the core game.)

## Creating New Works

You have the right to create new works derived from the SRD.

## Requirements

The biggest requirement for anything you do based on our work is attribution; you must give us credit for our work. The next section goes into detail on how you should do that.

Second, you can’t imply or state that Alex Roberts or Evil Hat Publications is endorsing or sponsoring you unless we’ve made a special arrangement with you. Don’t use the Evil Hat logo or the _For the Queen_ logo without talking to us first. There is a _Descended From the Queen_ logo you can use very easily, though; see above. Also, don't use the name _For the Queen_ in the title of your product.

Third, you may not use any material from _For the Queen_ that is not in the SRD content -- including but not limited to the specific prompts and artwork. You must create your own original material using the _For the Queen_ system as a base.

Finally, you can’t use the SRD to make something which would be prejudicial to Evil Hat Productions or Alex Robert's honor or reputation. (That’s exactly how the legal license puts it!) We’re not sure how you’d do that, but don’t.

That’s all the legal stuff. As always, if you’re unsure about exactly what to do or if you’re investing a lot of money in publishing something based on our work, think about talking to a lawyer.

This isn’t a legal requirement, but we’d love it if you let us know what you were doing with _For the Queen_ and maybe passed along a few copies — digital ones would be fine. Contact us!

## Attribution

So, how do you give us credit for our work?

This is really simple. Wherever you put your own copyright, add the following text:

<div class="well">
This work is based on <em>For the Queen</em> (found at http://www.forthequeengame.com/), product of Alex Roberts and Evil Hat Productions, and licensed for our use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
</div>

All the text has to be the same size as the rest of your copyright section — that’s one of the license requirements.

If you’re publishing electronically, you can make “Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license” a link to https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0 and “_For the Queen_” a link to http://www.forthequeengame.com/, instead of printing the URLs separately.

That’s it!
